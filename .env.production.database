# Production Database Configuration - NEON

# Neon Database URL (Prisma 6.x automatically handles pooled/direct connections)
# Get this from Neon dashboard > Connection Details > Pooled Connection
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://[user]:[password]@[project]-pooler.neon.tech/[database]?sslmode=require"

# Note: For Prisma 5.10+, you only need the pooled connection URL
# Prisma automatically uses direct connection for migrations
# and pooled connection for queries

# Connection Pool Settings (for Supabase/Neon)
# These are handled by the provider, but good to document:
# - Pool size: 10-25 connections for production
# - Connection timeout: 30 seconds
# - Idle timeout: 10 minutes

# Security Best Practices:
# 1. Always use SSL (sslmode=require or verify-full)
# 2. Use connection pooling for better performance
# 3. Rotate passwords regularly
# 4. Use read replicas for analytics if needed
# 5. Enable Row Level Security (RLS) in Supabase if using their auth
